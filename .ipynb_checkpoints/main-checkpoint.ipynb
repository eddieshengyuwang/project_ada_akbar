Hence, in order to answer to questions 3 and 4, the following structure is going to be  kept. It is important to mention that all the following investigations are not only done on a global scale, but with the help of the GDP data, the relationship between the set of economical and bureaucratic indicators and the number of offshore entities are inspected for different set of countries. The categories identified are 'Small developed countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Seven Biggest Economies' and 'Developed Countries'.\n",

    "- The largest part of the entities in the entity database is considered to be companies and businesses. \n",

    "- GDP is used as a measure of economic activity and power.\n",

    "The way in which the countries are categorized, although being arbitrarily, follow other categorizations diffused in the sociological and economic analysis. The second and forth assumption are linked to each other as basically an average of both data is taken. This can be considered correct as, even if the two periods of time considered not match, the largest amount of Panama Papers are concentrated in recent period. All the entries of entity database are considered as companies as even if they are referring to private households, they are still register as companies. GDP is quite a fair measure of the economic weight of a country as it describes the market value of all the final goods and services produced, in this case, yearly."

    "Firstly the graph of tax rate and presence in Panama Paper of small developed countries with high income per capita is plotted. In fact, by looking at these relationship it will be possible to understand if all small developed countries with high income per capita present favourable characteristics to go offshore. \n",

    "The GDP has been used as a weight for the count of entities offshore because the discrepancy between the size of the economies is really high.\n",
    "\n",
    "By observing the plot below some important considerations can be drawn; two set of countries can be identified: tax havens countries and small developed countries. Firstly the tax havens countries can be identified very easily since they have a high presence in the papers and at the same time they have really low tax rates. The rest of the countries are small developed usually European countries. The trend of non tax havens countries shows that high tax rate is not a factor pushing entities to go offshore; in fact the opposite could be true: there seems to be a negative exponential relationship between presence in panama papers and tax rates, but the two tail test p-value (0.395) of such relationship seems to imply that no relationship exist between tax rate and number of entities in Panama Papers for small developed countries. However this relationship could imply the presence of an hidden covariate: high tax rate might be synonym of tighter control and regulations on entities going offshore, meaning that countries with tighter controls will naturally have a lower number of offshore companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition the graph also seems to suggest that the resons behind the presence of many companies offshore in tax havens is not only the low taxation levels: in fact corporate tax rate of tax havens countries is often comparable to that one of other small european countries. As a matter of fact tax havens countries offer entities favorable conditions to easily set compabies offshore compared to other small countries."

    "Secondly the graph of tax rate and presence in Panama Paper of developing countries is plotted. BRICs countries have been considered, as well as all other countries which had a GDP greater than 40 billions USD a year. Also in this case the GDP has been used as a weight for the count of entities offshore because the discrepancy between the size of the economies is really high.\n",

    "By observing this graphs a negative exponential relationship can be again observed further showing that for this category of countries tax rate is not a factor pushing entities to go offshore: actually the higher the tax rate the lower the number of companies offshore. Contrary to the little evidence found in small developed countries, developing countries show a very clear negative exponential relationship with a two tails p-value of 0.00143. This could be a further proof to the hypothesis that higher tax rates are correlates with higher regulations as shown in the graph for small developed countries; in fact in developing countries the bureaucratic machine and regulation could even disable further entities who are willing to go offshore."

    "Graph of the biggest economies. The relationship between the 7 biggest economies and tax rate has been investigated. The economies almost correspond to the G7 countries, but China has taken the place of Canada. Even though these are the biggest economies in the world, the difference in size between them influence the probability of creating business and hence having companies offshore. As a consequence also in this case the GDP was used to weight the number of offshore entities present in the panama papers. \n",

    "The figure below shows a completely different picture, compared to the previous ones: taking out Japan, it seems to be a positive exponential relationship between tax rate and number of offshore entities for the economically strongest countries suggesting that in these countries (p-value=0.531), entities are escaping corporate taxation levels by putting their companies offshore. Japan represents an exception among the 7 biggest economies: even though it has a very high tax rate, the presence of Japanese entities in the documents is really low. This could be due to cultural reasons or might be due to the fact that Japanese entities use different means to go offshore and they are not very represented in the Panama Papers themselves."

    "By observing the plot below some important considerations can be drawn; again the two set of countries can be identified: tax havens countries and small developed countries. The first ones are visibile since they have a very high number of offshore entities and the second group can be identified below. In this case it is not possible to determine whether days to open a business influence entities in countries to go offshore. Hence it seems that for this category of countries no dependency can be drawn. In fact even the regression line that should show a negative exponential relationship between days to open a business and number of entities in Panama Papers has a two tail test p-value of 0.837, which confirms the hypothesis that the slope of the line should be zero.

    "In conclusion it is clear that corporate tax is definitely a factor influencing entities to go offshore, but in different ways according to the set of countries considered. It seems that entities in the major economies are trying to escape high corporate taxation levels. While it seems that lower taxation levels in developing countries implies a higher number of companies set offshore. However it is hard to make inference statements since the correlations are often not strong enough and correlation doesn't imply causation. Also the other indicators explored such as days to open a business or time spent in regulation by businesses haven't led to the hoped results: further indicators should be explored, but the challenge of finding reliable global data has to be overcome.\n",
    " \n",
    "Hence corporate tax rate is not the only determinant for entities to go offshore: in fact it was also concluded that corporate tax rate could actually be a proxy variable for other covariates. For instance it is clear that tax havens present ideal conditions for entities to set up offshore companies: additional research should be performed in finding what are theses bureaucratic and economical factors, but the lack of transparency of these countries makes it extremely to find useful data.

Different strategies were considered to make the latter average, as the purely arithmetic mean is not ideal. This is because different countries have very different weight in the world economy. One strategy was to use the GDP as weight of the country importance. This did not end up being a good solution as not all the values are available every year and so the absence of the value of a big country in one precise timestep would alter the result a lot. "

    "The resulting plot that can be seen here above. It can be seen that, on a world scale, there is no clear correlation between the develop of the GINI and the number of worldwide entities in the Panama Papers. To confirm the hypothesis that a higher number of panama paper is a sign of more inequality in the world, the two parameters would be positively correlated, so showing similar trend. All the countries in the world are very different from each other and their behaviour in the Papers can be influenced by a lot of other covariates. A machine learning algorithm could be a nice solution to find some relation using more features, but it would be very limited by the small amount of point available (the number of world countries)."

The result, as in the previous case of the Tax rate, is not very meaningful. The data frame analysed has a lot of missing data, hence showing a continuous trend of it just in the last 10 years.

Some of the causes behind going offshore can be explained with data; in fact further researches are needed to obtain a greater quantity of data and use them to explore which are determinants of the number of offshore companies. In addition the phenomenon is also a sociological one and the story of each entity should be treated separately. All in all a stakeholder analysis should be performed to understand which are the individuals that, hidden behind the privacy curtains of the offshore jurisdictions, evade taxation disabling a proper redistribution of wealth.
