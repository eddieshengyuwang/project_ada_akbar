    "As shown by the exploratory analysis, the entity document of the Panama Papers is a very interesting: it provides a macroscopic view of how many entities per countries are involved in settling companies offshore. The reasons behind making an offshore company are multiple: setting a company offshore is not a crime, but it is an indication that the business condition in the home country are not always favorable from a privacy point of view, from a bureaucratic point of view and from a tax point of view. In other words it is investigated whether the discrepancy between ease of business that exist between tax haven countries and non tax havens, can be a cause of high income inequality in non tax haven countries. The idea of investigating which of the top 2000 companies in the world are present in the Panama papers and estimate the capital lost was dropped because it is very hard to find the real name of the companies and link the two without doing a stakeholder analysis."

The majority of the entities present in the papers come from a country with already favourable business condition like Honk Kong, Switzerland and Luxembourg or even from a place considered a fiscal havens (Panama, Jersey). However there is evidence supporting the claim that many entities/companies coming from the above mentioned set of countries don't actually belong to those countries: in fact their GDP and their population are too low to explain such a high presence on a global scale. This fact can be explained with a tendency, amplified by globalization, of big companies of starting their international business already from a convenient country. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence it is porbable that entities from all over the world are firstly influenced to go set their businesses already in countries which offer particularly good business conditions such as Switzlerand, Panama, the Channel Islands (Jersey and Guernsey), Luxemburg, the Cayman Islands, Lichteinstein, Singapore and Monaco, Isle of Man and Gibraltar. These countries are known for being small and very developped with high income per capita, but also to often be tax havens. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, on the one hand it is crucial to understand what are these business conditions (economic and bureaucratic) that make this set of countries the optimum place to do business, but also to easily go offshore and on the other hand what are the economic and bureaucratic causes which influence entities in the other countries to go offshore.

    "By observing the plot below some important considerations can be drawn; two set of countries can be identified: tax havens countries and small developped countries. Firstly the tax havens countries can be identified very easily since they have a high presence in the papers and at the same time they have really low tax rates. The rest of the countries are small developped usually European countries. The trend of non tax havens countries shows that high tax rate is not a factor pushing entities to go offshore: in fact there is a negative exponential relationship between presence in panama papers and tax rates. However this relationship could imply the presence of an hidden covariate: high tax rate might be sinonim of tighter control and regulations on entities going offshore, meaning that countries with tighter controls will naturally have a lower number of offshore companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition the graph also seems to suggest that the resons behind the presence of many companies offshore in tax havens is not only the low taxation levels: in fact corporate tax rate of tax havens countries is often comparable to that one of other small european countries. As a matter of fact tax havens countries offer entities favorable conditions to easily set compabies offshore compared to other small countries."

There seems to be a positive relationship between income inequality and presence in the panama papers. This suggests that even if entities move their capitals/businesses offshore without the intention of evading taxes, the discrepancy between the business conditions with their own home country can correlate with high income inequality.
