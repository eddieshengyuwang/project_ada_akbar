## Introduction

In 2015, the world was shook from the news over a leaked corpus of 11.5 million financial and attorney-client documents relating to over 200,000 offshore entities called the **Panama Papers**. These documents were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked by an anonymous source.

## Why should I care?

Although Panama is miles away from EPFL, the implications from the leaked papers can relate very much to people here in Switzerland and all over the world. In fact Switzerland ranks first in the number of entities set up in offshore jurisdictions at 37911. While setting a company offshore is not a crime, there are illegitimate (and legitimate) implications that drive companies to do so. For instance, business conditions in the home country may be unfavorable from a privacy, bureaucratic, and tax point of view. Despite the fact that we cannot *prove* that companies set up offshore entities for illegal purposes, like tax evasion, it is safe to infer that it is a strong possibility, as even the anonymous leaker "John Doe" stated his intentions were based on growing income inequality and "scale of injustices".

## Our purpose

It is important to dive deeper into the massive corpus of leaked documents [provided here](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/) to better understand the reasoning why entities choose to set companies offshore so that future cases can be avoided. Furthermore, we will explore the consequences that offshore companies have on home countries from a wealth distribution point of view so that readers can really understand the order of magnitude that setting up offshore companies have on their country.

## A world map overview

Companies from a home *country* set up entities in various *jurisdictions* (offshore areas). Thus, we first investigate which *jurisdictions* hold the most entities and which home *countries* set up the most entities offshore.

To carry out this investigation a set of questions which provide a guideline for this analysis are going to be answered.

As shown by the exploratory analysis, the entity document of the Panama Papers is very interesting: it provides a macroscopic view of how many entities per countries are involved in settling companies offshore or funds offshore.

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
