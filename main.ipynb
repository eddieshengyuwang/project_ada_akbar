The majority of the entities present in the papers come from a country with already favourable business condition like Honk Kong, Switzerland and Luxembourg or even from a place considered a fiscal paradise (Panama, Jersey). This fact can be explained with a tendency, amplified by globalization, of big companies of starting their international business already from a convenient economy. Later queries will need to take into account these facts, maybe weighting output by indicator of the economic situation of the county of origin. \n",

The majority of the entities present in the papers come from a country with already favourable business condition like Honk Kong, Switzerland and Luxembourg or even from a place considered a fiscal havens (Panama, Jersey). However there is evidence supporting the claim that many entities/companies coming from the above mentioned set of countries don't actually belong to those countries: in fact their GDP and their population are too low to explain such a high presence on a global scale. This fact can be explained with a tendency, amplified by globalization, of big companies of starting their international business already from a convenient country. \n",

    "As a consequence it is porbable that entities from all over the world are firstly influenced to go set their businesses already in countries which offer particularly good business conditions such as Switzlerand, Panama, the Channel Islands (Jersey and Guernsey), Luxemburg, the Cayman Islands, Lichteinstein, Singapore and Monaco, Isle of Man and Gibraltar. These countries are known for being small and very developped with high income per capita, but also to often be tax havens. \n",

    "Firstly the graph of tax rate and presence in Panama Paper of small developped countries with high income per capita is plotted. In fact, by looking at these relationship it will be possible to understand if all small developped countries with high income per capita present favourable characteristics to go offshore. \n",

    "All the countries with GDP per capita `GDP_y`>30000 and a total GDP `GDP_x`< 200 billions USD have been considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GDP has been used as a weight for the count of entities offshore because the discrepancy between the size of the economies is really high.\n",
    "\n",
    "By observing the plot below some important considerations can be drawn; two set of countries can be identified: tax havens countries and small developped countries. Firstly the tax havens countries can be identified very easily since they have a high presence in the papers and at the same time they have really low tax rates. The rest of the countries are small developped usually European countries. The trend of non tax havens countries shows that high tax rate is not a factor pushing entities to go offshore; in fact the opposite could be true: there seems to be a negative exponential relationship between presence in panama papers and tax rates, but the two tail test p value (0.395) of such relationship seems to imply that no relationship exist between tax rate and number of entities in Panama Papers for small developped countrie. However this relationship could imply the presence of an hidden covariate: high tax rate might be sinonim of tighter control and regulations on entities going offshore, meaning that countries with tighter controls will naturally have a lower number of offshore companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition the graph also seems to suggest that the resons behind the presence of many companies offshore in tax havens is not only the low taxation levels: in fact corporate tax rate of tax havens countries is often comparable to that one of other small european countries. As a matter of fact tax havens countries offer entities favorable conditions to easily set compabies offshore compared to other small countries."

Japan represents an exception among the 7 biggest economies: even though it has a very high tax rate, the presence of Japanese entities in the documents is really low.

    "The resulting plot that can be seen here above. It can be seen that, on a world scale, there is no clear correlation between the develop of the GINI and the number of worldwide entities in the Panama Papers. To confirm the hypothesis that a higher number of panama paper is a sign of more inequality in the world, the two parameters would be positively correlated, so showing similar trend. All the countries in the world are very different from each other and their behaviour in the Papers can be influenced by a lot of other covariates. A machine learning algorithm could be a nice solution to find some relation using more features, but it would be very limited by the small amount of point available (the number of world countries)."
