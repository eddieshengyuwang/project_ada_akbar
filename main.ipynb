The majority of the entities present in the papers come from a country with already favourable business condition like Honk Kong, Switzerland and Luxembourg or even from a place considered a fiscal paradise (Panama, Jersey).

However there is evidence supporting the claim that many entities/companies coming from the above mentioned set of countries don't actually belong to those countries: in fact their GDP and their population are too low to explain such a high presence on a global scale. This fact can be explained with a tendency, amplified by globalization, of big companies of starting their international business already from a convenient country. \n",

Firstly the tax havens countries can be identified very easily since they have a high presence in the papers and at the same time they have really low tax rates. The rest of the countries are small developped usually European countries. The trend of non tax havens countries shows that high tax rate is not a factor pushing entities to go offshore; in fact the opposite could be true: there seems to be a negative exponential relationship between presence in panama papers and tax rates, but the two tail test p value (0.395) of such relationship seems to imply that no relationship exist between tax rate and number of entities in Panama Papers for small developped countrie. However this relationship could imply the presence of an hidden covariate: high tax rate might be sinonim of tighter control and regulations on entities going offshore, meaning that countries with tighter controls will naturally have a lower number of offshore companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition the graph also seems to suggest that the resons behind the presence of many companies offshore in tax havens is not only the low taxation levels: in fact corporate tax rate of tax havens countries is often comparable to that one of other small european countries. As a matter of fact tax havens countries offer entities favorable conditions to easily set compabies offshore compared to other small countries."

Japan represents an exception among the 7 biggest economies: even though it has a very high tax rate, the presence of Japanese entities in the documents is really low.

This suggests that even if entities move their capitals/businesses offshore without the intention of evading taxes, the discrepancy between the business conditions with their own home country can correlate with high income inequality.
