It is important to mention that all the following investigations are not only done on a global scale, but with the help of the GDP data, the relationship between the set of economical and bureaucratic indicators and the number of offshore entities are inspected for different set of countries. The categories identified are 'Small developped countries', 'Developping Countries', 'Seven Biggest Economies' and 'Developped Countries'.\n",

    "Firstly the graph of tax rate and presence in Panama Paper of small developped countries with high income per capita is plotted. In fact, by looking at these relationship it will be possible to understand if all small developped countries with high income per capita present favourable characteristics to go offshore. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the countries with GDP per capita `GDP_y`>30000 and a total GDP `GDP_x`< 200 billions USD have been considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GDP has been used as a weight for the count of entities offshore because the discrepancy between the size of the economies is really high.\n",
    "\n",
    "By observing the plot below some important considerations can be drawn; two set of countries can be identified: tax havens countries and small developped countries. Firstly the tax havens countries can be identified very easily since they have a high presence in the papers and at the same time they have really low tax rates. The rest of the countries are small developped usually European countries. The trend of non tax havens countries shows that high tax rate is not a factor pushing entities to go offshore; in fact the opposite could be true: there seems to be a negative exponential relationship between presence in panama papers and tax rates, but the two tail test p value (0.395) of such relationship seems to imply that no relationship exist between tax rate and number of entities in Panama Papers for small developped countrie. However this relationship could imply the presence of an hidden covariate: high tax rate might be sinonim of tighter control and regulations on entities going offshore, meaning that countries with tighter controls will naturally have a lower number of offshore companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition the graph also seems to suggest that the resons behind the presence of many companies offshore in tax havens is not only the low taxation levels: in fact corporate tax rate of tax havens countries is often comparable to that one of other small european countries. As a matter of fact tax havens countries offer entities favorable conditions to easily set compabies offshore compared to other small countries."

    "Secondly the graph of tax rate and presence in Panama Paper of developping countries is plotted. BRICs countries have been considered, as well as all other countries which had a GDP greater than 40 billions USD a year. Also in this case the GDP has been used as a weight for the count of entities offshore because the discrepancy between the size of the economies is really high.\n",
    "\n",
    "By observing this graphs a negative exponential relationship can be again observed further showing that for this category of countries tax rate is not a factor pushing entities to go offshore: actually the higher the tax rate the lower the number of companies offshore. Contrary to the little evidence found in small developped countries, developping countries show a very clear negative exponential relationship with a two tails p-value of 0.00143. This could be a further proof to the hypothesis that higher tax rates are correlates with higher regulations as shown in the graph for small developped countries; in fact in developping countries the bureaucratic machine and regulation could even disable further entities who are willing to go offshore."

    "Graph of the biggest economies. The relationship between the 7 biggest economies and tax rate has been investigated. The economies almost correspond to the G7 countries, but China has taken the place of Canada. Even though these are the biggest economies in the world, the difference in size between them influence the probability of creating business and hence having companies offshore. As a consequence also in this case the GDP was used to weight the number of offshore entities present in the panama papers. \n",

    "The figure below shows a completely different picture, compared to the previous ones: taking out Japan, it seems to be a positive exponential relationship between tax rate and number of offshore entities for the economically strongest countries suggesting that in these countries (p-value=0.531), entities are escaping corporate taxation levels by putting their companies offshore. Japan represents an exception among the 7 biggest economies: even though it has a very high tax rate, the presence of Japanese entities in the documents is really low. This could be due to cultural reasons or might be due to the fact that Japanese entities use different means to go offshore and they are not very represented in the Panama Papers themselves."

In this case it is not possible to determine whether days to open a business influence entities in countries to go offshore. Hence it seems that for this category of countries no dependency can be drawn. In fact even the regression line that should show a negative exponential relationship between days to open a business and number of entities in Panama Papers has a two tail test p-value of 0.837, which confirms the hypothesis that the slope of the line should be zero.

Different strategies were considered to make the latter average, as the purely arithmetic mean is not ideal. This is because different countries have very different weight in the world economy. One strategy was to use the GDP as weight of the country importance. This did not end up being a good solution as not all the values are available every year and so the absence of the value of a big country in one precise timestep would alter the result a lot. "

    "The resulting plot that can be seen here above. It can be seen that, on a world scale, there is no clear correlation between the develop of the GINI and the number of worldwide entities in the Panama Papers. To confirm the hypothesis that a higher number of panama paper is a sign of more inequality in the world, the two parameters would be positively correlated, so showing similar trend. All the countries in the world are very different from each other and their behaviour in the Papers can be influenced by a lot of other covariates. A machine learning algorithm could be a nice solution to find some relation using more features, but it would be very limited by the small amount of point available (the number of world countries)."
